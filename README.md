append_key_value.py
The script updates a key-value pair in a configuration file, ensuring the value is added without duplicates, and preserving any existing content.
It allows the user to specify a custom delimiter. It reads the file, processes each line, appends the new value if necessary, and writes the changes back, with debugging logs showing each step.
